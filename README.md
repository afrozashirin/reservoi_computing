# reservoi_computing
Reservoir computing with optimized time delay. These codes find the training and testing error for a RC with optimized time delay.
Please run "Lorenz_nonlinear_coupled_optimization_test.m" file to compute the training and testing error for the reservoir computing with optimized time delay and with Lorenz attractor.
